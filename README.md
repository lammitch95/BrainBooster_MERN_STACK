## Technology Stack
**Frontend**:
  - **React**: Used for building the user interface with reusable components.
  - **CSS3**: Used for styling the application and creating a responsive layout.
    
**Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for building the server-side logic.
  - **Express.js**: A minimal web framework for Node.js used for routing and handling HTTP requests.
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user data and study sets.
  - **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for secure user authentication and session management.

## Installation
1. **Install Node.js**: If Node.js is not installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en) and install it on your system.
2. **Add Node.js and npm to System PATH**: Ensure Node.js and npm are added to your systemâ€™s PATH for easy access in the terminal.
3. **Install nodemon globally** (optional, but useful for development to auto-restart the server):
   npm install -g nodemon


## Run Application
**Split Terminal:** You will need to run both the frontend and backend servers at the same time.
Run command **npm run dev** on server and web directory
